Design a beautiful, premium, futuristic landing page for SanctOS, a next-generation encrypted messaging + private wallet + decentralized node network on Solana.

Use the official SanctOS aesthetic:

Gradient Sphere Logo (primary identity symbol) — glowing orb with smooth gradients (violet → neon lilac → soft fuchsia).

Typography: clean, geometric, minimal (similar to Inter, Neue Montreal, Söhne, or Space Grotesk).

Dark mode only: deep charcoal backgrounds (rgb 10,10,15), subtle grain texture, neon diffused glows.

Primary colors:

Electric Violet (#a75cff)

Neon Lilac (#e7a7ff)

Soft Fuchsia (#f099ff)

Aqua Electric Blue (#5fceff)

Accent elements: glassmorphism cards, blurred glows, floating particles, Solana-like neon gradients.

Overall style:
Elegant cyberpunk minimalism, privacy-centric, futuristic, premium, Apple-level polish.

PAGE STRUCTURE — MUST INCLUDE ALL SECTIONS BELOW
1. HERO SECTION (above-the-fold)

A dramatic intro with large gradient sphere logo floating subtly.
Elements to include:

Huge headline: “SanctOS — The Privacy OS for Solana”

Subheadline: “Encrypted messaging. Private DeFi. Decentralized nodes. A sovereign communication layer.”

“Launch App” button — neon glow

“Learn More” secondary button

Background: floating orbs, faint Solana-like light beams

Animated gradient accents

A subtle holographic “matrix” dot pattern

Goal: premium, mysterious, secure, powerful.

2. WHAT IS SANCTOS (Overview section)

Clean, 2–3 sentence explanation with iconic orb visual centerpiece.

Text example:
“SanctOS is an encrypted messaging platform and private Solana wallet built on a decentralized privacy network. No phone numbers, no servers, no metadata. All encrypted. All yours.”

Design notes:

Two-column layout

Left = copy

Right = glowing 3D sphere or holographic interface

3. CORE FEATURES GRID (4–6 cards)

Each feature in a glowing glass card.

Feature Cards to Include:

Encrypted Messaging
“End-to-end XSalsa20 encryption with wallet-based identity.”

Private DeFi Mode
“Hide your IP, device, and metadata on every dApp.”

SanctOS Nodes
“Decentralized private relays and encrypted storage.”

Kill-Switch Identity
“Burn your old identity forever with one tap.”

On-Chain Messaging PDAs
“Serverless, censorship-resistant communication.”

SanctOS Wallet
“Fast, private, auto-signed transactions.”

Visual style: neon borders, soft shadows, minimal icons.

4. PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE (deep-dive)

Diagram or schematic showing:

Device Keys

Wallet Key (identity)

Shared Secret (ECDH)

XSalsa20 Encryption

Message PDAs

Zero metadata design

Node relay

Style: blueprint-like, neon lines, holographic aesthetic.

Section header: “Engineered for Absolute Privacy”

5. PRIVATE DEFI MODE SECTION

Hero-style callout with the glowing sphere split into multiple refracted beams.

Copy:
“Access any Solana dApp privately. SanctOS routes all transactions through your personal node relay, hiding your IP, device, timing, and metadata.”

Include small diagrams:

Wallet → Node → RPC

Timing obfuscation

RPC rotation

6. ENCRYPTED MESSAGING SECTION

Focus on clean UI mockups + encryption iconography.

Text snippets:

“No phone numbers.”

“No emails.”

“No servers.”

“No metadata stored.”

Design:

Chat UI preview with neon accents

Encrypted bubbles

Lock icons

7. NODES SECTION (Lite, Home, Hardware)

This is a huge section — visually impressive.

Show 3 card types:

Lite Node: personal local relay

Home Node: small device (Pi, mini-PC)

Hardware Node: premium future SanctOS device

Include:

Points system

Relay

Encrypted media storage

Future: CoinJoin + Stealth lanes

Use floating hardware-like renders, neon traces, and glows.

8. GHOST SEND (COINJOIN) SECTION

Dark background, glowing fractal network animation.

Text:
“Break transaction linkability. Ghost Send mixes your transaction with others without custodial risk, making on-chain tracing impossible.”

Show a simple 3-step diagram:

Users submit masked inputs

SanctOS node builds the combined transaction

Metadata self-destructs

9. ROADMAP SECTION

Elegant timeline with 4 phases:

MVP (messaging + wallet + private relay)

Lite Nodes

Encrypted media + Group chats

Full decentralization (storage, CoinJoin, node network)

Design: thin neon lines linking milestones.

10. DOWNLOAD / LAUNCH / INSTALL SECTION

Buttons for:

Launch App

Node Installer (coming soon)

Desktop App (future)

In a glass panel with glowing CTA.

11. FAQ SECTION

Accordion style, minimal.

Include questions like:

“Is SanctOS really private?”

“How does encryption work?”

“How do nodes protect me?”

“Does SanctOS store metadata?”

Dark panels, neon outline.

12. FOOTER

Minimal, dark, sleek.
