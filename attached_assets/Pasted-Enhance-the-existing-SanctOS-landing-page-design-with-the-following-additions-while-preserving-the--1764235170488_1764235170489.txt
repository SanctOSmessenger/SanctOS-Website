Enhance the existing SanctOS landing page design with the following additions, while preserving the SanctOS floating orb aesthetic exactly as defined in the provided CSS (glowing gradient sphere, soft pulses, floating sparks, ethereal orb animations).

Use the same visual style:
premium dark-mode cyber-neon, glowing gradients (violet → lilac → fuchsia → aqua-blue), glassmorphism, soft bloom, geometric clean typography (Inter / Space Grotesk), Solana-like futuristic privacy aesthetic.

🔵 1. KEEP THE FLOATING ORB — HERO MUST FEATURE IT PROMINENTLY

Use the SanctOS orb exactly as defined:

Gradient radial glow

Hover scale + opacity change

Pulse + floating keyframes

Floating spark particles around it

Place the orb:

In the HERO section

Front and center
– Behind the headline
– Slightly lifted
– Ethereal, futuristic
– The core of SanctOS identity

Also reference it in other sections as subtle smaller floating orbs.
