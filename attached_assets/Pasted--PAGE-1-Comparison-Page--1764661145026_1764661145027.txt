Category Breakdown
1. Identity & Account Setup

SanctOS: Wallet-based, no phone, no email, device-level keys.

Signal: Phone number required, tied to real identity.

Session: Anonymous Session ID.

Telegram: Phone number required.

WhatsApp: Phone number required; Meta ecosystem.

2. Message Transport Layer

SanctOS: Blockchain-based (Solana transactions). No servers, no routing hops.

Signal: Messages routed via centralized Signal servers.

Session: Mixnet + service nodes + storage nodes.

Telegram: Fully centralized cloud servers.

WhatsApp: Fully centralized Meta infrastructure.

3. Encryption Model

SanctOS: XSalsa20-Poly1305 + ephemeral keys, minimal and auditable.

Signal: Robust Double Ratchet protocol.

Session: Modified Signal to support decentralized nodes.

Telegram: Default chats not E2EE, only “Secret Chats.”

WhatsApp: Uses Signal protocol.

4. Metadata Protection

SanctOS: No IP logs, no routing metadata, no servers, no timestamps stored.

Signal: IP/timing metadata visible to servers.

Session: Mixnets reduce metadata but storage nodes still see pull patterns.

Telegram/WhatsApp: High metadata exposure (server logs, cloud sync).

5. Censorship Resistance

SanctOS: Cannot be censored; messages live on-chain permanently.

Signal/Session/Telegram/WhatsApp: All can be blocked at the server or network level.

6. Web3 Integration

SanctOS: Built for Web3, private DeFi mode, wallet-native messaging.

All Others: No on-chain features, no wallet identity, no private DeFi.

Summary

SanctOS eliminates servers entirely and stores encrypted messages directly on-chain, making it the only fully censorship-resistant, wallet-native messenger.
Signal protects content.
Session decentralizes servers.
Telegram and WhatsApp prioritize convenience.
SanctOS delivers full decentralization, privacy, and Web3 integration.

PAGE 2 — SanctOS Nodes Page
=============================================
SanctOS Nodes — What They Do (Now vs Future)

Nodes are optional components that enhance privacy, performance, and decentralization.
SanctOS works fully without them — but nodes unlock the advanced features of the ecosystem.

1. Private RPC / Metadata Shield

Status: Coming in Phase 2

Hides IP address

Hides request timing

Routes all Solana RPC traffic through your node

Masks messaging activity

Nodes provide a privacy firewall between the user and public RPC endpoints.

2. Performance & Caching

Status:

Basic caching → Live in Phase 1

Encrypted persistent cache → Phase 2

Nodes reduce latency by caching:

conversation indexes

message search results

signature lookups

account data

This results in faster sync and lower RPC cost.

3. Encrypted Media Storage

Status:

No media: Now

Local encrypted storage: Phase 3

Distributed encrypted file storage: Phase 4

This enables:

encrypted photos

voice notes

documents

media vaults

All without centralized servers.

4. Relay & Mix Coordination

Status:

Node relays → Phase 3

Multi-hop mixnet routing → Phase 4

Nodes will eventually:

relay encrypted packets

coordinate timing obfuscation

perform multi-hop routing

enable background sync for offline devices

5. Points & Incentives

Status: Starts in Phase 2

Early Light Node users earn points for:

uptime

caching contributions

relaying (Phase 3+)

storing encrypted media (Phase 3+)

Phase 4 introduces:
→ Points → Credits → Token rewards.
